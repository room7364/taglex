ИД и НМС
- Выполняется при отсутствии дыхания и сердцебиения
- Перед началом проведения ИД пострадавшего уложить на спину, расстегнуть стесняющую одежду и нанести удар кулаком по грудине, то есть сделать механическую дефибриляцию, убедившись перед этим что пульс на сонной артерии отсутствует. Обеспечить проходимость верхних дыхательных путей (устранить рвотные массы и съёмные зубные протезы), наложить на рот и нос пострадавшего салфетку и приступить к проведению ИД.
- Оказывающий помощь располагается сбоку от пострадавшего, максимально запрокидывая голову, делает глубокий вдох, плотно охватывает губами рот пострадавшего и делает выдох, с некоторым усилием вдувая воздух в рот пострадавшего. Одновременно он закрывает нос пострадавшего щекой или пальцами руки.
- При сочетании ИД с НМС, если оживление проводит один человек, то на каждые два вдувания необходимо сделать пятнадцать надавливаний на грудину. При участии двух человек в оказании помощи соотношение "дыхание-массаж" соответствует 1 : 5.
- При проведении НМС оказывающий помощь кладёт ладонь левой руки на нижнюю половину груди, правой - поверх левой поперек или вдоль и надавливает, помогая тяжестью тела. Руки при надавливании должны быть выпрямлены в локтевых суставах. Ни в коем случае нельзя надавливать на верхнюю часть грудной клетки и окончание нижних ребер, так как это может вызвать перелом и повредить внутренние органы. Надавливание следует производить энергичными толчками так, чтобы смещать грудину на 4 - 5 см. Продолжительность надавливаний не более 0,5 секунд, интервал между надавливаниями 0,5 секунд
- После того как будет определяться пульс и появится самостоятельное дыхание мероприятия по оживлению пострадавшего прекратить

Универсальная схема оказания первой помощи на месте происшествия
- Если нет сознания и нет пульса на сонной артерии - приступить к реанимации
- Если нет сознания но есть пульс на сонной артерии - повернуть на живот и очистить ротовую полость
- При артериальном кровотечении - наложить жгут
- При наличии ран - наложить повязки
- Если есть признаки переломов костей конечностей - наложить транспортные шины

Причины возникновения пожара (5)
Причинами пожаров могут быть:
- Нарушения при проведении огневых работ
- Нарушения хранения, уборки горючих отходов, промасленной ветоши, одежды
- Неисправности электрооборудования, электропроводки
- Курение в пожароопасных местах и не в специально отведенных для этого местах
- Аварийные воспламенения на трубопрводах кислорода и природного газа

Средства пожаротушения
Здания и помещения должны быть обеспечены первичными средствами по¬жаротушения. Для их размещения на террито-рии предприятий устанавливают специ¬альные щиты. На щитах размещается следующий ручной пожарный инвентарь: ло¬мы, багры, топоры, ведра. Рядом со стендом устанавливается ящик с песком и лопа¬тами, а также бочка с водой емкостью 200-250 литров.

При пожаре ломы, багры, лопаты, топоры применяют для разборки деревянных конструкций. Лом сильным ударом вводят между досок, после чего, работая им, как рычагом, отрыва¬ют доски пола или перего-родки. Если огонь проник в междуэтажное перекрытие, штукатурку отбивают кольцом багра.

Топор применяют для перерубания досок, конструктивных элементов, открывания дверей.

Кошма предназначена для изоляции очага горения от доступа воздуха. 'JIOT метод очень эффективен, но применя-ется лишь в небольшом очаге горения. Горящий предмет следует быстро накрыть кошмой, стремясь лучше изолиро-вать от доступа воздуха и держать до полного прекращения горения.

Для тушения пожаров внутри зданий используют противо-пожарные водопроводы, снабженные пожарными кранами.
